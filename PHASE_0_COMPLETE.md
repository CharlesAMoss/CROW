All Phase 0 objectives have been successfully completed:

1. **Documentation Created**
   - ✅ `README.md` - Updated with comprehensive project overview
   - ✅ `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Detailed system architecture and design decisions
   - ✅ `PLANNING.md` - 14-phase development roadmap with checkpoints

2. **Dependencies Installed**
   - ✅ Vitest - Testing framework
   - ✅ @vitest/ui - UI for running tests
   - ✅ jsdom - DOM environment for tests
   - ✅ @testing-library/react - React component testing utilities
   - ✅ @testing-library/jest-dom - Custom matchers
   - ✅ @testing-library/user-event - User interaction simulation

3. **Project Structure Created**

       ├── setup.ts        ✅ Test configuration
       └── setup.test.ts   ✅ Verification test
   ```

4. **Testing Framework Configured**
   - ✅ `vitest.config.ts` - Vitest configuration with coverage
   - ✅ `src/test/setup.ts` - Test environment setup
   - ✅ Added test scripts to `package.json`:
     - `npm run test` - Run tests in watch mode
     - `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with UI
     - `npm run test:coverage` - Generate coverage report

5. **Verification Tests Passed**
   ```
   ✓ src/test/setup.test.ts (2 tests)
     ✓ Project Setup
       ✓ should pass basic assertion
       ✓ should handle basic math
   ```

6. **Build Verification**
   - ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
   - ✅ Vite build successful
   - ✅ No errors or warnings

### Test Results

**Build Test:**
```bash
npm run build
✓ 31 modules transformed
✓ built in 553ms
```

**Test Suite:**
```bash
npm run test -- --run
Test Files  1 passed (1)
Tests       2 passed (2)
Duration    1.01s
```

### Architecture Decisions Made

1. **Display Modes**: Four core modes (fullbleed, spreadsheet, workflow, nested-list)
2. **Type System**: Generic types with TypeScript 5.9 features
3. **State Management**: React Context + useReducer
4. **Styling**: CSS Modules + Custom Properties
5. **Performance**: Virtual scrolling for large datasets
6. **Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library

### Key Documentation

- **ARCHITECTURE.md** details:
  - System layers and component hierarchy
  - Type system design with generics
  - Data flow and state management
  - Performance optimization strategies
  - Display mode implementations
  - File structure

- **PLANNING.md** includes:
  - 14 detailed phases
  - Deliverables for each phase
  - Testing criteria and checkpoints
  - Risk management
  - Success metrics

### Next Steps - Phase 1: Type System

Ready to begin Phase 1 after approval:

1. Create `src/types/grid.types.ts` - Core grid types
2. Create `src/types/config.types.ts` - Configuration interfaces  
3. Create `src/types/feature.types.ts` - Feature module types
4. Create `src/types/data.types.ts` - Data provider types
5. Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation
6. Verify all types compile correctly

### Questions for Approval

Before proceeding to Phase 1, please confirm:

1. ✅ Is the architecture approach acceptable?
2. ✅ Are the four display modes (fullbleed, spreadsheet, workflow, nested-list) sufficient?
3. ✅ Is the phased development plan clear?
4. ⏳ Any specific requirements for the type system?
5. ⏳ Any additional dependencies needed?
6. ⏳ Any concerns about the tech stack choices?

### Recommendations

1. **Proceed to Phase 1** if architecture is approved
2. Consider adding:
   - `react-window` or `react-virtual` for virtual scrolling (can add in Phase 4)
   - `date-fns` for date handling (can add when needed)
   - Additional export formats later (xlsx, pdf)

### Project Health

- ✅ Build: Passing
- ✅ Tests: Passing (2/2)
- ✅ TypeScript: No errors
- ✅ ESLint: No errors
- ✅ Dependencies: Installed

**Phase 0 Status: 100% Complete**
